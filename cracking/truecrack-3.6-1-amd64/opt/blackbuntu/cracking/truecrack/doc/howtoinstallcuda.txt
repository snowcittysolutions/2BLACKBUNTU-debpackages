HOW TO INSTALL CUDA
-------------------

Nvidia provides two main version:  
- CUDA TOOLKIT 4.0 (MAY 2011): stable version ( http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-40 )
- THE CUDA 4.1 RELEASE CANDIDATE2 (RC2): unstable version ( http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-41 )

CUDA TOOLKIT 4.0 (MAY 2011)
---------------------------
If you use the cuda stable version 4.0 remember the following rules:
- compile the old nvidia developer driver 270.41.19 <= you can compile it if and only if you use a kernel of the family 2.6
- install the 4.0 toolkit, the sdk and set the opportune environment variables with the path of your cuda directory
- use a gcc compiler of the family 4.4 <= gcc 4.5 and 4.6 are not supported with CUDA

THE CUDA 4.1 RELEASE CANDIDATE2 (RC2)
-------------------------------------
Else if you use the cuda release candidate version 4.0 remember the following rules:
- compile the old nvidia developer driver 285.05.23 <= you can compile with a kernel of the family 2.6.x or 3.x
- install the 4.1 toolkit, the sdk and set the opportune environment variables with the path of your cuda directory
- use a gcc compiler of the family 4.4 <= gcc 4.5 and 4.6 are not supported with CUDA


WARNINGS ABOUT GCC VERSION
--------------------------
In the release candidate version 4.1, if you compile the software (make GPU=true) with a unsupported gcc version, it appears the following message:
"#error -- unsupported GNU version! gcc 4.6 and up are not supported!"
If you used the cuda stable version 4.0, this message don't appear and the compilation ends without errors. Anyway the program don't work correctly.

WARNINGS ABOUT DRIVER VERSION
-----------------------------
If you compile and use a version of nvidia driver different or upper (as the most recent version) the program crash, the system crash andthe machine crash.

CONCLUSION

Have a good day and enjoy yourself in cracking password,
