This is a document written for the package mantainer

The SniffJoke 0.4.x is intended only for Linux, and the package mantainer have some
operations to check.

As first: I will notice every package mantainer with a signed mail, when a new stable
          release of sniffjoke has been uploaded in the site.

Git release must not be intended as stable, almost until we don't split the two 
branches in 'devel' and 'master'

TROUBLE+POSSIBLE BUGS WHILE COMPILING:

    Warnings because the option implement virtual classes has not destructor 
    (under CentOS causes a verbose shit)

    If you are running centos QA, tell to us eventually warnings

TROUBLE+POSSIBLE BUGS WHILE INSTALLING:

    The usage of different paths, unability to call the three executables, not
    indexed man pages

    sniffjoke-autotest use 'locate' inside, for found some relevant directory, if you
    want to avoid, you should set the variable LOCSDIR= by hand, at the start of the
    script

TROUBLE+POSSIBLE BUGS WHILE RUNNING AUTOTEST:

    Immediate exiting after the test of segmentation,INNOCENT
    (try the same command line with --foreground option, and check the exception raised)

    network error: unability to contact delirandom.net
    (check if you can, with curl, reach the links hardcoded in sniffjoke-autotest)

TROUBLE+POSSIBLE BUGS WHILE SJ IS RUNNING:

    SniffJoke is broking all session
    (try to use --location 'generic', now run in limitated but stable supports)

    SniffJoke crashes
    (use --debug 6 --foreground and check when the service is quitting)


TROUBLE+POSSIBLE BUGS WITH THE SJ CLIENT:

    Check if your architecture is little or big endian
    (this will be a serious hardcoded bug by us!)

    Check if the client connection is working with telnet
    (because you should have incidentally some firewall rules)
