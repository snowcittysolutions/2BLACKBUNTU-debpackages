/service:
        contains the main sources for the sniffjoke software

/client:
        contains sources for a command line interface written to manage
        sniffjoke service;
        in doc/ you will find the file SJ-PROTOCOL.txt, ad document that
        describe the protocol used for service-client communication.
        if you want to write a QT or other cool-GUI sniffjoke manager,
        we are glad to import it.

/plugins:
        sniffjoke is an "anti sniffing SDK" or a "framework for userspace
        connection mangling" and the plugins are in fact the funny little
        code able to crumble to dust the thousand-dollar IDS apparatus
        your boss has buyed.

        at the moment not documentation are provided, but if you are capable
        to develop a plugin, I'll suggest to read in this order:

        fake_close_rst (simple injection of a packet)
        fake_close_fin (usage of cache and logging)
        fake_data      (generation of two packets)
        segmentation   (packet removed and substituted)

        use a lot of tcpdump and let us know, we have some ideas to develop
        and few time.

/autotest:
        scripts used during autotest analysis, sniffjoke-autotest check the
        plugins + scramble combinations, and sj-iptcpopt-probe check the
        IP/TCP options header supports provided by your ISP/gateway
