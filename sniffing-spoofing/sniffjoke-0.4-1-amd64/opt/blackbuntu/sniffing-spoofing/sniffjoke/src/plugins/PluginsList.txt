THE PLUGINS CATEGORY ARE:

    forcedClosing
    badSync
    payldBreakin

The division in categories was made because the plugins attack, at this moment, will be 
divided in three big categories.

forcedClosing
    The plugins inside this directory will try to inject packets who should bring an interruption.
    If the interruption don't work, is not required try randomly for the entire session length,

    Common facts about those plugins:

    1) Its require an internal caching for inject a limited number inside a connection: these attacks
       work as "one-shot", if a sniffer follow it, a better mechanism of injection has been evaluated

    TODO
       fake_close_fin alredy implement that, is required make some MACROS inside Plugin.cc 

    2) Its will provide the random internal selection of foreseen the incoming ACK from the received,
       or to inject a packet that alone make the interruption

badSync

    The injection here placed will damage the reassembled flow internal routines, it try to disrupt
    the seq-acking in both directions

payldBreakin

    The payload Breaker plugins inject data in a smart way, fragment the packets in different layers,
    and try the overlapping segment attack (at the moment, under testing). 

    These in the future will be expanded with layer 5 and more, injection

HDRoptions_probe
    Used only by autotest software (called in sj-iptcpopt-probe shell script)
