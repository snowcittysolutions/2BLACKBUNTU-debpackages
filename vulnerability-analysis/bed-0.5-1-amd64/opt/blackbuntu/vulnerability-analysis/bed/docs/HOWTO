 Howto use BED?


Using BED is quit simple :) Decide which protocol you want to stress test
and start bed using the commandline

 perl bed.pl -s plugin -t 192.168.0.1

BED will then run for a while, any maybe report to you that a connection attempt
to the service failed. If this is the case you might have detected a bug. Next step
is to run BED again with a higher timeout between the testcases, depending on the 
duration of your coffee break, values of 5 to 30 seconds are fine. So restart the
daemon or box and run BED again, using the -o switch. If BED reports a crash at the
same place again, take a look at the module you where using ( in bedmod/xxxx.pm ) and
search for the testcase, then run it by hand ( either using netcat and perl or write
your own script ) agains the daemon, if you can reproduce the problem, its time to look
at the sources, coredump or using a disassembler and debugger to find out whats really
happening in there. If BED reports the crash at another test, just increase the timeout
a bit more until you found the testcase which produces the crash, just do some trial and
error stuff, because sometimes the crash happens much later than you sending the data.
I had wait times up to 2 Minutes with a Lexmark T522 printer, until the box finally
crashed and called for service :)

Thats about it... enjoy
